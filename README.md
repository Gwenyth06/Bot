# XBot
 An X bot which posts voice lines of a specific character from TF2, Medic.

 It uses firebase to store the data pulled from Team Fortress 2 Wiki and X API v2 to post voice lines.
 If you want to use this repo in your project, you have to get the credentials for Firebase and the X API.
 I am now hosting this bot on PythonAnywhere which has a free option for hosting specifically Python files with limited resources.
 The important libraries that are used in this project are: BeautifulSoup, Tweepy and Firebase Admin.

 You can find the bot here --> https://twitter.com/MeeedicBot
